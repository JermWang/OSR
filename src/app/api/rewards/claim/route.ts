/**
 * Claiming runs the opposite way to the priced actions: the protocol pays the
 * operator, so there is nothing for them to send and no two-phase quote. The
 * server settles the accrual and transfers OSR from the protocol wallet.
 *
 * Order matters. The accrual is consumed BEFORE the transfer is sent: if it
 * were sent first and the state write then failed, the same rewards could be
 * claimed again and drain the reserve. A failed transfer after a successful
 * write is the safer direction — the amount owed is recorded so it can be
 * retried, rather than silently lost.
