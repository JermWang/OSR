'use client';

// Deploy awareness for the client.
//
// Polls /api/status and exposes two things the UI needs during a release:
//
//   deploying   — a deploy window is open, so risky actions must be refused.
//                 A spend sends OSR on-chain BEFORE the server records anything,
//                 so a cutover landing between those two steps costs the player
//                 real tokens and leaves us owing a refund. Refusing to start is
//                 far cheaper than reconciling afterwards.
//
//   stale       — the server is now serving a different build than the one this
//                 tab loaded. The tab reloads itself onto the new version.
//
// Reloading is deferred while an action is in flight: interrupting a settle
// mid-flight is the exact failure this is meant to prevent.
